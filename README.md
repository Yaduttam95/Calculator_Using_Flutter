Instead of being a real hardware device, a software calculator is one that has been implemented as a computer programme.
Because they are among the most straightforward interactive software tools, they offer operations that the user may choose from one at a time. Since these operations are the only, or at least the main, features of the calculator rather than being ancillary features that support capabilities that is not typically known as simple calculation, they can be used to perform any process that consists of a series of steps each of which applies one of those operations and has no other intent.

As a calculator, as opposed to a computer, they typically have a small set of relatively basic operations, carry out quick computation-light operations, do not accept a lot of input data, and do not generate a lot of output.

This calculator is capable of carrying out fundamental operations such addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and computing the residual or the remainder (also known as the modulus operation) when two numbers are divided.

This programme supports two themes:
* Light Theme
* Dark Theme

This app was created with Flutter.  
Google's Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit. It is used to create cross-platform apps from a single codebase for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web.
